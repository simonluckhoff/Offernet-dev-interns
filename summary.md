# Summary of Recent Tasks and Troubleshooting
**AI Bots:**
- Python Learning in order for Bot Development
- Three different AI Bots, experimenting with code flow.
- Integration of API keys.
- Saving answers to json/csv.
- Testing to break the bot. 
- Created a 4th bot using the Llama model (was very slow)

**Command Centre Dashboards:**
- Dashboard TV’s in the command centre. 
- Learning how the computer is set up, connecting my Mac via Anydesk to set it up every morning.
- If any problems, to identify it, solve it or report to the relevant department. (Guided by Jamie & De Wet)

**Big Query:**
- Big Query Familiarisation - Omnibase-Master & Data Team Sandbox (very important to understand what is the data & where it’s coming from)
- Learning to feed into Looker Studio
- Running SQL Queries to create views (grouping relevant data)
- Understanding Looker tools, metrics and dimensions.  

**Dashboards For Irfaan (GCP Service Monitor)**
- First real big data to work with. Connecting Big Query to Looker.
- Understanding what the dashboard needs to show.
- Navigating how to display the data in Looker. 

**SQL Queries**
- Currently working on deciphering Johan's SQL Queries that built the Sprout Dashboards. 
- Difficulty level turned up, much more intricate. 
- Gaining a better understanding of what Sprout is. 

**Takedown Request Status’s (Dashboard)**
- Researching an automation process (via python script) to setup a dashboard for Sonwa’s takedown request status’s.
- Using the Playwright module, to scrape the relevant info (via locator tool), save to json/csv and feed into Looker Studio via Google Sheets.

**Unassigned, but for learning purposes**
- Automated python scripts, with a single phrase in the terminal, launches my workspace automatically and another phrase to close all applications. 
- Various small Python projects to gain better understanding (Calculator, Dice game, PyGame)
- Django experimentation to gain better understanding of Python frameworks. Built a to-do web app. 
- Javascript, responsive navbar’s and image carousels. 

- Poking my head into each department, trying to understand the inner mechanics. (Sonwa - brand protection, De Wet - Wordpress, Edwin - CSM)
- Understanding & adapting to the work environment and pace.
- Being orderly and timely fashioned.

Things I have worked on

Actively Contributed To:

Naming Conversions Google Sheets (Irfaan)
Practice Dashboard Development  (Stephan)

Chatbots:

Built with Flask and Twilio.
Integrated Gemini AI for user input validation and explanations.
Used structured conversation flow with session tracking via SQLAlchemy.
Included quick replies/buttons for a guided user experience.
Designed to distinguish between AI and Python-controlled logic.

Endpoint Dashboards – Collaborated with Irfaan to develop and improve endpoint-related dashboards.
Customer Insight Report – PDF Export Feature – Implemented PDF download functionality for the customer insight reports.
Sprout dashboard (currently)






Personal Projects for Learning Purposes:

Google Apps Script Dashboard – Created a dashboard using Google Apps Script to explore automation and custom UI options within Google Sheets.
SQL-Based Expense Tracker – Built a small project using Python and SQL to track and visualize expenses.
Document generator - Feed new information on array form and program updates a word docuemt then converts to pdf


Research :

BigQuery, SQL & Looker Studio – Explored best practices, query optimization, and dashboard development techniques.
Apps Script for Google Sheets – Learned scripting to automate tasks and build custom features.
Optimal Dashboard Design Layouts – Researched best UI/UX practices for clean and efficient dashboard presentations.
WordPress Fundamentals – Gained exposure to WordPress while shadowing De Wet.

Technologies & Tools I Have Learned:

Python – Flask and Django frameworks.
PHP – Basic understanding and usage.
Looker Studio – For interactive dashboard creation and data storytelling.
BigQuery – For data storage, querying, and integration with Looker.
SQL – Used across BigQuery, local databases, and personal projects.
Microsoft Excel – For data manipulation, pivot tables, and dashboard mockups.
